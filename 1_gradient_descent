Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in deep learning.
It minimizes the loss function, which measures the difference between predictions and actual data.
The algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's parameters (like weights).
Adjustments are made in small steps, moving in the direction that reduces the loss.
The goal is to reach the optimal parameters that minimize the loss.
This process helps the model learn from data and improve predictions.
